PROJECT TITLE: Corona Run Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Ap Comp Sci Final
VERSION or DATE: 
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Paige Keller
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
1) I set the panel size to 500 by 500 so if your tab is full screen the game will still only be in the 500 by 500 square.
2) The green moving balls on the screen are representative of the corona virus, if you get hit by it you lose!
3) To win collect 10 pink powerups while avoiding the corona virus.
4) After the start button is pressed the game starts right away so be ready!
